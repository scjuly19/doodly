# doodly
 A chrome extension to make doodle on tabs.
 - This is inspired by the coding challenge of Daniel Shiffman's Coding train.
 Checkout his awesome tutorials [here](https://shiffman.net/a2z/chrome-ext/) and the best part if they are all free.
 - This is not a publish extension so you can download a zip of this repo and unpack it in developer mode in chrome.

- As you see above, you can pick a color and stroke width for your strokes.
- Note: It doesn't persist the choosen color right now, but will update it soon.
